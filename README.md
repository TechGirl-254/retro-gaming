# The-Maze
This project has been created by Wamata Muriu.

However, several resources have helped in realizing the overal project, and will be recognized in the sources section at the bottom of this document.

## Technologies Used

I used the following technologies to create the game.

Ubuntu Version 20.04

C programming language

SDL2

SDL website: https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php

OPENGL Libraries

OPENGL website: https://www.opengl.org/

CODE BLOCKS

CODE BLOCKS website: https://www.codeblocks.org/

## How to play

To play this game, you need to install the SDL2 library, clone the repository, then using the MakeFile. You can execute the file using:

- make
- make run

commands or opt to execute the executable (./The_Maze).

The player can use the 'w' key to move up, 's' to move down, 'a' to move left, and 'd' to move right.
When you get to a door, you can click the 'e' key to open it.

## My story

Curiosity. That's the beginning of my story. It's actually how I got into software development to begin with. 

I don't think I have ever thought of being a game developer, but I have always been curious as to how games were made. How did the graphics come together, how were the features engineered.

So when I got enough skills to be slightly better than a rookie in C programming, and I realized I didn't need an gaming engine to make a game, well, I decided to give it a shot, and here I am.

## What is The Maze

The Maze game is literally what its name suggests. It depicts a player, stuck at the center of a maze. There are multiple tunnels to explore to find their way out of the maze, if they can.

## Inspiration

I wish I had a life-changing story to explain why I went ahead to design this game, but I don't. The main and only reason I pursued this quest was to satisfy my curiosity, to finally feel that I understood a bit of the magic behind game development.

## How to develop without a game engine

At this point in time, I don't know what is easier, to develop a game with or without a gaming engine.

While technologies like SDL2 make it easy to come up with non-game engine games, they are not easy to master. There are volumes of libraries to read, a tonne of functions to understand and MATH!!! 

But it was worthit in the end. SDL helped me create the gaming window, player movements, rays, and render the necessary colors, and textures.

## What I could have done more

- I could have added other objects to the game. Like enemies, weapons, etc.
- I could have added more effects.

So why didn't I do this, honestly, time was my sole constraint considering I built the project all by  myself.
